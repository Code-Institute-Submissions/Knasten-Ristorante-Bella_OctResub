# Testing

* I tested the responsiveness of the page in chrome devtools using all the standard screen sizes.
* This page was tested in different browsers: Chrome, Firefox and Edge
* I tested the form and confirmed that it only accepts the wanted data in every field.

# Bugs

* After deploying my project to Github Pages, I saw that my project didn't resize as expected, aswell as a few alinging problems with the form.
    * After looking over the code I found the problem. It was my mediaqueries label width and after setting this right it aligned as it should.
    * I also had a problem with font sizing as it would make text stick out from footer and compress the text in the header.
    
    * Changing the width in my mediaqueries for smaller screen aswell as my font-size in body element fixed the problems.
* No bugs was left unfixed.
