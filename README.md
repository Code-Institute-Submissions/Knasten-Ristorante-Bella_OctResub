# Testing

* I tested the responsiveness of the page in chrome devtools using all the standard screen sizes.
* This page was tested in different browsers: Chrome, Firefox and Edge
* I tested the form and confirmed that it only accepts the wanted data in every field.

# Bugs

* After deploying my project to Github Pages, I saw that my project didn't resize as expected, as well as a few aligning problems with the form.
    * After looking over the code I found the problem. It was my mediaqueries label width and after setting this right, it aligned as it should.
    * I also had a problem with font sizing as it would make text stick out from the footer and compress the text in the header.
    
    * Changing the width in my mediaqueries for smaller screen as well as my font-size in body element fixed the problems.
* No bugs was left unfixed.
# Validation

* HTML
    * No errors when testing it through the offical W3C validator
    
* Accessibility
    * I made sure my chosen colors and fonts are easy to read by running it through lighthouse extension on chrome.
